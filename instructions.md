# Day 1 Homework: Build a Lakebase-Powered AI Support App

## Objective

Build and deploy a small Databricks App backed by Lakebase. Your app will become the foundation for the context-engineering and AI-agent projects later in the boot camp.

---

## Scenario

You are building an internal support system where users can create support tickets and add messages to those tickets.

Your application must store its operational data in Lakebase.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Create the Lakebase schema

Create at least these two related tables:

#### `tickets`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ticket_id` | Primary key |
| `title` | Ticket title |
| `status` | Current ticket status |
| `created_by` | User who created the ticket |
| `created_at` | Creation timestamp |

#### `ticket_messages`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `message_id` | Primary key |
| `ticket_id` | References `tickets.ticket_id` |
| `message_text` | Message content |
| `author` | Message author |
| `created_at` | Creation timestamp |

**Requirements:**

- `ticket_messages.ticket_id` must reference a ticket in the `tickets` table.
- You may add additional columns or tables.

---

### 2. Add sample data

Your database must contain:

- At least **three** support tickets.
- At least **two** messages for each ticket.
- At least **two** different ticket statuses, such as:
  - `open`
  - `in_progress`
  - `resolved`

---

### 3. Build a Databricks App

Create an app that allows a user to:

- View all support tickets.
- Select a ticket and view its messages.
- Create a new ticket.
- Add a message to an existing ticket.
- Update a ticket's status.

The app must **read from and write to Lakebase**. Hard-coded application data does **not** count.

---

### 4. Deploy and test the app

Deploy the app using Databricks Apps and confirm that:

- Existing tickets load from Lakebase.
- A new ticket can be created.
- A message can be added.
- A ticket's status can be updated.
- Changes remain after refreshing the app.

---

# What to Submit

Submit **one document or form response** containing:

- Your Databricks App URL
- Your source code (zipped)
- A screenshot of the deployed application
- A screenshot showing the Lakebase tables and sample records
- A short reflection (3–5 sentences) answering:
  - What was the most difficult part?
  - How is Lakebase different from storing this data in a traditional analytics table?
  - What feature would you add next?

---

# Bonus Challenges

Earn recognition for completing one or more of these:

- Add ticket priority or category.
- Add filtering by ticket status.
- Add input validation and helpful error messages.
- Display ticket statistics.
- Add delete functionality with a confirmation step.
- Improve the visual design of the application.

---

# Important

Do **not** submit passwords, database credentials, API keys, or secret values.

Your application should access credentials through the Databricks environment or another secure configuration method.
